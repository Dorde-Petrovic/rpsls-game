# Design


## Features

The website has only one page. I used the base from Portfolio Project Scope Video by Matt Rudge
I made sure that Computer couldn't pick the same object that Player already has picked.

## Accessibility
The website is as accessible as possible:
- Using semantic HTML
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughtout the site.
- Using descriptive aria-label in the buttons
- Providing information for screen readears where there are icons used and no text.
- Confirming through lighthouse in devtools.

## Typography
The font Henny Penny is imported from Google Fonts.

## Icons
I didn' use any.
